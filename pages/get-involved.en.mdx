# Get Involved

We're looking for public goods maxis to help us build and launch PGN. If that is you, there are two ways you can join the community and get involved:

1. Join the [Telegram community](https://t.me/+9_ZHRaz7nmJkMTIx) if you're interested in building on PGN and helping us set up core infrastructure on the protocol.
2. If you are interested in deploying on PGN, or joining the [Alliance](/faq#what-is-the-public-goods-alliance), please reach out to pgn@gitcoin.co.

We also encourage you to provide feedback or make contributions to our developer docs in GitHub.

### Contributing to Internationalizing Our Documentation

Contributing to the internationalization of our documentation is a rewarding way to support our project and enhance its accessibility. We follow the "docs-as-code" model, which treats documentation as code, making it easier for both developers and non-developers to contribute. Here's a simple set of steps you can take to make an open-source contribution to our internationalization efforts:

#### Step 1

First off, you should be making contributions to this [documentation repository](https://github.com/supermodularxyz/pgn-docs) on GitHub.

#### Step 2

Once you've opened a new branch, you will need to make updates the following updates before translating any content:

In `next.config.js`, please add the language code of the language you are working with to `i18n` > `locales`. 

Example: 

```js filename="next.config.js" {7-10}
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx'
})
 
module.exports = withNextra({
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'zh', 'de'],
    defaultLocale: 'en'
  }
})
```

In `theme.config.jsx`, please make sure to add your language under `i18n`to configure the language dropdown.

Example: 

```js filename="theme.config.jsx"
i18n: [
  { locale: 'en', text: 'English' },
  { locale: 'zh', text: '中文' },
  { locale: 'de', text: 'Deutsch' },
  { locale: 'ar', text: 'العربية', direction: 'rtl' }
]
```

#### Step 3

Next, you will duplicate all the files that you intend on translating and change the file name to have the locale codes as your file extension.

Example:

```plaintext
/pages
  _meta.en.json
  _meta.zh.json
  _meta.de.json
  index.en.md
  index.zh.md
  index.de.md
  ...
```

#### Step 4. 

Translate the content into the chosen language.

#### Step 5

Create a pull request to submit the translated pages to the team for review. 

#### Step 6

Check back periodically to see what changes have been made to the docs so you can help adjust the translated pages.
