# Understanding PGN Gas Fees

In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, gas fees play a crucial role in facilitating transactions and interactions within the network. Gas fees are essentially the charges users pay to execute operations or smart contracts on the network. These fees serve multiple purposes: they incentivize miners or validators to process transactions, prevent spam or malicious activities, and contribute to the overall security and sustainability of the network.

On PGN, gas fees work similarly but with some unique characteristics. This documentation page aims to provide you with a clear understanding of gas fees on the L2 chain, including details about priority fees, optimizing gas costs, and making adjustments for transaction success.

## Priority Fees and User Control

One key aspect of gas fees on the L2 chain is the priority fee. This fee determines the speed at which your transaction gets processed. It's important to note that while gas fees are influenced by network demand and congestion, the priority fee is a parameter that users have control over.

## Optimizing Gas Costs 

At this time, you might notice that the priority fee estimation on Metamask can be on the higher side. While PGN has low network activity, there are fewer transactions competing for processing. Because of this, you have the opportunity to optimize your gas costs by lowering the priority fee to reduce the overall cost of your transaction. 

We suggest lowering priority fees to start. If the transaction doesn't go through in five minutes, you can resubmit the transaction with a higher priority fee.
