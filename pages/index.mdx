In a world where public goods funding is not abundant and bountiful, many organizations
who believe in the importance of public goods are often looking for novel ways to
fund them.

**Gitcoin is no different.**

After years of raising and deploying capital based on community sentiment (ie, Quadratic Funding) we recognize the need to grow the pie from which we can all fund public goods. We grow weary from chasing individual funders to ensure the sustainability of our collective Public Goods Funding mission (though we recognize the importance of this practice and will continue it).
