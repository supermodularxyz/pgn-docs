# Ethereum and PGN comparison

PGN is an L2 that was built using the [Bedrock](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/explainer/#protocol) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack built on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/).

Due to this, PGN shares more similarities with Ethereum than differences. However, there are some key differences that make PGN different from Ethereum. 

If you are interested in building on PGN, we strongly recommend you understand the key differences outlined in the OP Stack documentation: [Differences between Bedrock and L1 Ethereum](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/)
